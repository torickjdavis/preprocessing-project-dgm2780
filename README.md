Preprocessing allows for faster and more organized development.  Being able to take a design and convert it into HTML and CSS is a common skill required for full stack developers in any industry.

Often you get to decide how to build a website but not the content.  This will be a great exercise for you to be creative in a given theme.  All content should be fake, don't waste time with copy writing.

I mimicked the layout from [La Finesse | Nosotros](https://lafinesse.es/nosotros) as inspiration for a landing page and primary layout, and [Tesla Apparel](https://shop.tesla.com/us/en/category/apparel.html) for the shop page.

## Project Requirements (*Multi-Page Website Styled with LESS*)

### Website
- [x] **Theme**: Does your design match the theme (**biking**, spa, bookstore) you picked?
- [x] Create a second page of your choice.
- [x] Create navigation between the home and secondary page(s).
- [x] Create buttons on each page with a call to action for the user. (Ex: Sign Up, Buy Now, etc)

### Preprocessing
- [x] **Variables**: Showcase your knowledge of variables by creating a font stack variable and three different colors variables.
- [x] **Nesting**: Did you nest your LESS to resemble/match your HTML structure?
- [x] **Imports**: Use at least 3 imports in your project.
- [x] **Mixins**: Create 3 unique mixins.
  - [x] Two mixins of your choice.
  - [x] Create a mixin that creates a custom button using parameters. User this on your buttons.
- [x] **Responsive**: Create a mobile version of the pages using escaped variables. Nothing complex is expected; you can simply stack your content on top of itself.
